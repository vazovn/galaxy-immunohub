		With great help from <a target="_blank" class="reference" href="https://www.usit.uio.no/">USIT</a> 
		and <a target="_blank" class="reference" href="https://elixir.no/">ELIXIR</a>
		Oslo, we are setting up a web-based platform that improves accessibility to and convenience of immune receptor analysis
		for computational immunologists and life science researchers at UiO and OUS.

		We are integrating a variety of tools for processing and analysis of immune receptors into one platform based on the 
		<a target="_blank" class="reference" href="http://galaxyproject.org/">Galaxy framework</a>, 
		developing web-based interfaces for each tool and streamlining their interoperability. This web-based platform not only makes the 
		functionality available to a new segment of life science users, but also saves efforts related to installation and tool interoperability 
		for computationally experienced researchers. As a final bonus, the Galaxy platform has strong built-in support to improve transparency, 
		collaboration and reproducibility.
	    </p>
 	    <p class="lead">
		The immunoHub platform is planned to be fully operational by December 2020.  Development has progressed well and several tools are already in place, 
		so please go ahead already and use <a target="_blank" class="reference" href="http://129.240.189.178:8080">immunoHub</a>.
